Imagine that you are working for a software company and have joined the Online Bookstore project,
which has recently implemented a new order processing system in order to enhance efficiency. The
system involves the use of various data structures and algorithms like: stack, queue, sorting, and
searching to manage customer orders.

node.js for the backend
express for the frontend
mongodb for the database
vue.js for the frontend

Chart.js or D3.js for visualizing algorithm performance

fullfil the following 4 requirements:
Task 1. Create a
design specification
for data structures
explaining the valid
operations that can
be carried out on the
structures.
Task 2. Implement a
complex ADT and
algorithm in an
executable
programming
language to solve a
well-defined problem
Task 3. Demonstrate
how the
implementation of an
ADT/algorithm solves
a well-defined
problem.
Tasks 4. Critically
evaluate the
complexity of the
implemented
ADT/algorithms
