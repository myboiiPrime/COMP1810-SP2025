## 1. Core Data Structures Complexity Analysis

### 1.1 Stack ADT

#### Time Complexity Analysis
| Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Justification |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| `push()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Direct array append operation |
| `pop()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Direct array removal from end |
| `peek()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Array index access |
| `isEmpty()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Length comparison |
| `size()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Property access |
| `clear()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Array reassignment |
| `toArray()` | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) | Array copying |

#### Space Complexity Analysis
- **Storage**: O(n) where n is the number of elements
- **Auxiliary Space**: O(1) for all operations except `toArray()` which requires O(n)
- **Memory Overhead**: Minimal - only array storage and size tracking

#### Critical Evaluation
**Strengths:**
- Optimal O(1) performance for core stack operations
- Minimal memory overhead
- Cache-friendly due to array-based implementation

**Weaknesses:**
- Fixed maximum capacity may cause overflow in high-load scenarios
- Array resizing (if implemented) would cause O(n) operations
- No built-in persistence or recovery mechanisms

**Real-world Performance:**
In the bookstore system, the stack is used for order history with a maximum of 1000 entries. With typical order processing rates of 100-1000 orders/minute, the fixed capacity is adequate and provides predictable performance.

### 1.2 Priority Queue ADT (Binary Heap)

#### Time Complexity Analysis
| Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Justification |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| `enqueue()` | O(1) | O(log n) | O(log n) | Heap insertion with bubble-up |
| `dequeue()` | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | Root removal with bubble-down |
| `peek()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Root access |
| `isEmpty()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Size check |
| `size()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Property access |

#### Space Complexity Analysis
- **Storage**: O(n) for heap array
- **Auxiliary Space**: O(1) for heap operations
- **Memory Layout**: Compact array representation with good cache locality

#### Heap Property Maintenance
```
Heap Invariant: For any node i:
- Parent priority ≥ Child priority (max-heap)
- Complete binary tree structure
- Array indices: parent(i) = ⌊(i-1)/2⌋, children(i) = 2i+1, 2i+2
```

#### Critical Evaluation
**Strengths:**
- Guaranteed O(log n) performance for priority operations
- Optimal for priority-based processing
- Efficient memory usage with array representation
- Stable performance under varying load conditions

**Weaknesses:**
- O(log n) complexity may become significant with very large queues (>10,000 orders)
- No support for priority updates without O(n) search
- Heap structure rebuilding after bulk operations can be expensive

**Performance Analysis:**
With typical order volumes of 1,000-5,000 pending orders:
- Enqueue/Dequeue: ~10-13 comparisons maximum
- Memory usage: ~40KB for 5,000 orders (assuming 8 bytes per element)
- Cache performance: Good due to array locality

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Implement d-ary heap (d=4) for better cache performance
- Add bulk operations for batch processing
- Consider Fibonacci heap for frequent priority updates

| `isFull()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Counter comparison |
| `isEmpty()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Counter comparison |
| `getUtilization()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Arithmetic calculation |

#### Space Complexity Analysis
- **Storage**: O(k) where k is the fixed capacity
- **Memory Efficiency**: 100% utilization of allocated space
- **Overhead**: Minimal - only pointers and counter

#### Circular Buffer Mathematics
```
Buffer State Calculations:
- Next position: (current + 1) % capacity
- Full condition: count == capacity
- Empty condition: count == 0
- Utilization: count / capacity
```

#### Critical Evaluation
**Strengths:**
- Perfect O(1) performance for all operations
- Fixed memory footprint - no dynamic allocation
- Excellent cache performance due to sequential access patterns
- Predictable behavior under all load conditions

**Weaknesses:**
- Fixed capacity limits scalability
- Memory waste if capacity significantly exceeds typical usage
- No automatic resizing capability
- Overflow handling requires external logic

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Throughput**: Limited only by CPU and memory bandwidth
- **Latency**: Constant time regardless of queue size
- **Memory Access Pattern**: Sequential, cache-friendly

**Real-world Application:**
In the order processing pipeline with 100-order capacity:
- Processing rate: 1000+ orders/second achievable
- Memory usage: Fixed 8KB (assuming 80 bytes per order)
- Overflow handling: Backpressure to upstream components

| `addBack()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1)* | Direct index manipulation |
| `removeFront()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Index increment |
| `removeBack()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Index decrement |
| `peekFront()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Array access |
| `peekBack()` | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | Array access |
| `compact()` | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) | Array reorganization |

*Amortized analysis - occasional array expansion may cause O(n) operations

#### Space Complexity Analysis
- **Storage**: O(n + k) where n = elements, k = unused allocated space
- **Space Efficiency**: Variable, depends on usage patterns
- **Memory Fragmentation**: Possible with sparse arrays

#### Amortized Analysis
```
Amortized Cost Analysis:
- Sequence of m operations on initially empty deque
- Total cost: O(m) for m operations
- Amortized cost per operation: O(1)
- Worst-case single operation: O(n) during compaction
```

#### Critical Evaluation
**Strengths:**
- Flexible insertion/removal at both ends
- Amortized O(1) performance for all core operations
- Supports both stack and queue operations efficiently
- Good for sliding window algorithms

**Weaknesses:**
- Worst-case O(n) operations during compaction
- Memory usage can be unpredictable
- Sparse array implementation may waste memory
- Complex index management increases bug potential

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Best Use Case**: Frequent additions/removals at both ends
- **Memory Pattern**: Can become fragmented over time
- **Compaction Strategy**: Triggered when fragmentation exceeds threshold
